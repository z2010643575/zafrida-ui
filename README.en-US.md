Project Introduction
-----------------------------------

<h3 align="center">Frida GUI Tool for PyCharm/IntelliJ</h3>

ZAFrida UI is a Frida graphical interface plugin integrated into PyCharm and JetBrains IDEs. It aims to solve the complexity of Frida command-line operations and script management by providing a complete **UI interaction interface** to manage devices, processes, scripts, and logs.

The core highlight is its **"Checkbox-style" Template Management System**: users can dynamically insert code snippets into the main script or comment them out simply by checking/unchecking boxes, enabling a "block-building" style of Hook script assembly. Additionally, the plugin features built-in **Project Management** (`zafrida-project.xml`), supporting quick switching between multiple devices and environment configurations.

ZAFrida does not replace Frida but serves as a powerful UI wrapper for `frida-tools`, seamlessly connecting with your existing Python and Frida environment.

Quick Start
-----------------------------------

1.  **Install Plugin**: Search for "ZAFrida" in the IDE Plugin Marketplace or install via disk.
2.  **Configure Environment**: Go to `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `ZAFrida` and configure `frida` executable paths (if not auto-detected).
3.  **Create Project**: Right-click in Project View -> `New Frida Project`.
4.  **Write/Select Script**: Select your `agent.js` in the Run Panel.
5.  **Hook & Debug**:
    * Connect device (USB or Remote).
    * Select target process or package name.
    * Click **Run**.
6.  **Use Templates**: Switch to the `Templates` tab, check the Hook functions you need (e.g., "SSL Pinning Bypass"), and the code will be automatically injected into your script.


Features
-----------------------------------

* **Device & Process Management**  
  Integrated with `frida-ls-devices` and `frida-ps`, supporting one-click device refresh and viewing running processes, apps, or installed packages.

* **Multiple Connection Modes**  
  Full support for **USB**, **Remote**, and **Gadget** modes, with customizable remote host and port—no need to manually construct complex CLI arguments.

* **Interactive Script Execution (Run / Attach)**
    * Supports **Run (default Spawn)** and **Attach** as explicit execution actions rather than a simple mode switch.
    * Supports **Force Stop** to terminate target applications.
    * Built-in console output with automatic log persistence to the `zafrida-logs/` directory.

* **JS Editor Context Menu (Important)**
    * Right-click inside a Frida JS editor to directly choose:
        * **Run Frida JS** – run the currently opened JS file as the main script (default Spawn).
        * **Attach Frida JS** – attach the currently opened JS file to an already running target process.
    * The file is automatically saved before execution, and the corresponding ZAFrida Project is auto-selected.
    * Ideal for quick PoC validation, demos, Gadget mode, or attaching to live processes.
    * **Shortcut**:
        * Windows / Linux: `Ctrl + Alt + S`
        * macOS: `⌘ + ⌥ + S`

* **Editor Snippets Insertion**
    * Provides **ZAFrida Frida Snippets** in the JS editor context menu.
    * One-click insertion of common Frida code patterns, including:
        * `Java.perform` wrappers
        * Java method hook templates
        * Native hooks via `Interceptor.attach`
        * Module / export enumeration
        * `send()` log helpers
    * Insertions are performed via WriteCommandAction, fully undo/redo safe.

* **Dynamic Template System (Core Innovation)**
    * Built-in Android / iOS hook templates (e.g., SSL Pinning Bypass, Method Hook, Native Hook).
    * **Checkbox-driven control**: check to insert code, uncheck to automatically comment it out—no manual deletion required.
    * Supports custom templates with real-time preview inside the IDE.

* **Run Script + Attach Script Separation**
    * Supports a primary **Run Script** and an independent **Attach Script**.
    * Enables clean separation between startup hooks and runtime injection logic for advanced debugging workflows.

* **Project-Based Configuration (ZAFrida Project)**
    * Introduces the ZAFrida Project concept to persist devices, targets, scripts, attach scripts, and connection parameters as a complete working context.
    * In the Project View, supports:
        * `New Frida Project`
        * `Select Frida Project`
        * `Load Frida Project`
    * UI state and configuration are automatically restored when switching projects.

* **Smart Python / Frida Environment Resolution**
    * Automatically detects the current PyCharm project’s Python SDK (venv / conda).
    * Dynamically injects PATH to ensure the correct `frida` / `frida-tools` are used.
    * Handles Remote and Gadget scenarios to avoid incorrect local environment injection.

* **Developer Aids**
    * One-click installation of `frida-gum.d.ts` for type hints and intelligent code completion in Frida JS.

Use Cases
-----------------------------------
ZAFrida UI is suitable for all scenarios involving reverse engineering with Frida, especially:
* Android / iOS App penetration testing and reverse analysis.
* Debugging processes requiring frequent switching of different Hook scripts.
* Engineers accustomed to using IDEs (PyCharm/IDEA) for mixed Python and JS development.

Technical Documentation
-----------------------------------

- **Requirements**:
    - IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm (Recommended 2024.3+)
    - Python3 and `frida-tools` installed locally (`pip install frida-tools`)
    - Ensure `frida`, `frida-ps`, and `frida-ls-devices` are in the system PATH or configured in plugin settings.

- **Issues**: [Github Issues](https://github.com/yilongmd/zafrida-ui/issues)

Start the Project
-----------------------------------
